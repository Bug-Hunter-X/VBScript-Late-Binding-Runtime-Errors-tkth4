To resolve late binding issues, use error handling to gracefully catch and handle situations where objects or methods are not found:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim obj
Set obj = CreateObject("NonExistent.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error creating object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End If
On Error GoTo 0
```
Alternatively, use early binding (declaring object types) when possible for better compile-time error detection.
